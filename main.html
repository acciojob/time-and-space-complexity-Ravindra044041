	<h1>Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
    <p>Time complexity is a measure of how efficiently an algorithm solves a problem. It assesses the amount of time an algorithm takes to run as a function of the size of the input data. An efficient algorithm typically has low time complexity, meaning it can solve problems quickly, even for large inputs.</p>
    <p>Space Complexity is another crucial aspect of algorithm analysis. It evaluates the amount of memory or space an algorithm requires to execute in relation to the input size. In terms of space complexity, we often use Big O notation (e.g., O(n)) to describe how an algorithm's space usage scales with the input size. The <b>Space Complexity</b> of an algorithm is a critical factor in determining its efficiency and suitability for various computing environments.</p>
